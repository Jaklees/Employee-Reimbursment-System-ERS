Persistence layer (I think) talking to Postgres DBeaver Database:
1. Users can register/login
2. Users can submit/view/edit reimbursements
3. Can filter reimbursements by status, username, reimbursement_ID

Through Postman:
1. Users can register/login
2. Can get a user by username
3. Can create reimbursements
4. Can get all reimbursements of "status"

UI:
1. Can Register new user that will get added into Database
2. Can log in with previously created user
